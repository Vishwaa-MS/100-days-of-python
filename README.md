# 100-days-of-python
I started my coding journey with this course. I learnt python and practiced in daily basis. In this course you will we taught lessons daily on day bassis, and by the end of the day you will make a project (depends on the topics) where you will use the knowledge you have gained. I persona;y found this course useful and the instructor is jusy awesome.
